# Introduction

The idea for this group project was to come up with a strategy that either exploited an arbitrage opportunity in the market, or represents another form of hedge fund strategy. Our group decided to focus on using technical indicators. Within this area, we specifically chose moving averages, and as a suitable market for their application settled on metal commodities.

# Economic Rationale

# Method Used
## Portfolio Allocation

In order to ideally work within the metals markets, the portfolio will consist ocmpletely of two already existing indices that are calculated on a daily basis, the S\&P Precious Metals Index, consisting of [TBC] and the S\&P Industrial Metals, containing [TBC]. By using these two indices as our baseline instead of attempting to construct our own, we can create a two-security portfolio with different weights to find the best possible results. As for the choice of allocations, we tried different combination weights of the indices. 

To construct the efficient portfolio, we had to calculate the return and variance of the two separate indices.
```{r}
# Return - Variance Calculation for the Separate Metals Indices
industrials_price <- na.approx(zoo(combined_indices$ind_close, combined_indices$date))

precious_price <- na.approx(zoo(combined_indices$pm_close, combined_indices$date))

rets_industry <- Return.calculate(xts(industrials_price),  method = "discrete")
names(rets_industry) <- "return_ind"

rets_precious <- Return.calculate(xts(precious_price),  method = "discrete")
names(rets_precious) <- "return_prec"

combined_indices <- cbind(combined_indices, rets_industry, rets_precious)

# Calculating Statistics for the Industrials Index
stats_industrials <- combined_indices %>% 
  subset(select = -c(pm_close, precious_metals)) %>% 
  summarise(mean_ind = mean(return_ind[-1]),
            sd_ind = sd(return_ind[-1]))

# Calculating Statistics for the Precious Metals Index
stats_precious <- combined_indices %>% 
  subset(select = -c(ind_close, industrial_metals)) %>% 
  summarise(mean_prec = mean(return_prec[-1]),
            sd_prec = sd(return_prec[-1]))

```

```{r}
# Efficient Portfolio
# Statistics for the Portfolio: Mean, StDev, Correlation
calc_efficient <- combined_indices %>% 
  summarise(mean_ind = mean(return_ind[-1]), mean_prec = mean(return_prec[-1]),
            sd_ind = sd(return_ind[-1]), sd_prec = sd(return_prec[-1]),
            corr_ind = cor(return_ind[-1],return_prec[-1]))

# Function to calculate the Weighting of Industrial Metals in the Final Portfolio
sh_r_max <- function(x){
  (x*calc_efficient$mean_ind+(1-x)*calc_efficient$mean_prec)/sqrt(x^2*calc_efficient$sd_ind^2+(1-x)^2*calc_efficient$sd_prec^2+2*x*(1-x)
  *calc_efficient$sd_ind*calc_efficient$sd_prec*calc_efficient$corr_ind)
}

# Calculating optimal weights for industrial index
efficient_weight_opti <- optimize(f = sh_r_max, lower = -1,upper = 1, maximum = TRUE)

# assigning weights to the two indices
weight_industrial <- efficient_weight_opti$objective
weight_precious <- 1-weight_industrial

# creating (theoretically) efficient combination
efficient_portfolio <- combined_indices %>% 
  mutate(
    efficient = 
      weight_industrial * industrial_metals + 
      weight_precious * precious_metals) %>% 
  subset(select = c(date, efficient))
```

```{r}
# 50/50 Portfolio

# Weights
eq_w_pm <- 0.5
eq_w_ind <- 1-eq_w_pm

# calculate index
eq_w_ind <- combined_indices %>% 
  mutate(eq_weight = eq_w_pm * precious_metals + eq_w_ind * industrial_metals) %>% 
  subset(select = c(date, eq_weight))
```

```{r}
# Joining the Portfolios
# Add Equal Weights to Individual Indices
indices_equal <- right_join(eq_w_ind, combined_indices, by = "date") %>% 
 subset(select = -c(ind_close, pm_close )) %>% 
  subset(select = -c(return_ind, return_prec))

# Add Efficient Portfolio
four_portfolios_main <- left_join(indices_equal, efficient_portfolio, by = "date")
```

```{r}
equal_price <- na.approx(zoo(four_portfolios_main$eq_weight, four_portfolios_main$date))
rets_eq <- Return.calculate(xts(equal_price),  method = "discrete")
names(rets_eq) <- "return_eq"

efficient_price <- na.approx(zoo(four_portfolios_main$efficient, four_portfolios_main$date))
rets_eff <- Return.calculate(xts(efficient_price),  method = "discrete")
names(rets_eff) <- "return_eff"

# Statistics for the Equal Weight Portfolio
four_portfolios_main <- cbind(four_portfolios_main, rets_eq)
stats_eq <- four_portfolios_main %>% 
  summarise(mean_eq = mean(return_eq[-1]),
            sd_eq = sd(return_eq[-1]))

# Statistics for the Efficient Portfolio
four_portfolios_main <- cbind(four_portfolios_main, rets_eff)
stats_eff <- four_portfolios_main %>% 
  summarise(mean_eff = mean(return_eff[-1]),
            sd_eff = sd(return_eff[-1]))
```

### Portfolio Graph 
```{r, fig.width = 11, echo=FALSE}
# combining the four portfolios into one
four_portfolios_consolidated <- left_join(indices_equal, efficient_portfolio, by = "date") %>% 
  gather(index, values, eq_weight:efficient)

# Combination Graph
ggplot() + 
  geom_line(data = four_portfolios_consolidated, aes(x=date, y=values, color = index), size = 0.4) + 
  labs(title = "Price Development of the Different Combinations of Metals Indices",
       caption = "Source: Finaeon, S&P as of October 2020",
       x = "Date",
       y="Index (1 = 1/1/1990)") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2", type = "qual", name = "Series", labels = c("Efficient Portfolio", "Equal Weights", "Industrial Metals", "Precious Metals")) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "12 months", date_labels =  "%Y") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=60, hjust=1))
```

The graph shows clearly that the most efficient portfolio is one in which the heaviest weighting is placed on the precious metals component of the portfolio, which is not surprising given it's outperformance of the industrial metals class, especially over the last ten years. For a further analysis, this raises the obvious question of whether a more efficient portfolio could be constructed using different indices/components that would diversify the returns away from this sector. 

```{r}
# Sharpe Ratios

# Assumed Risk Free Rate, based on current 10-Year US Treasuries 
risk_free <- 0.0076

# Sharpe Ratio Function
sharpe <- function(dataset, mean, sd){
  (dataset$mean - (risk_free / 365)) / dataset$sd
}

# Sharpe Ratios for the Individual Indices
sharpe_ind <- sharpe(stats_industrials, mean_ind, sd_ind)
sharpe_prec <- sharpe(stats_precious, mean = mean_prec, sd = sd_prec)
sharpe_efficient <- sharpe(stats_eff, mean_eff, sd_eff)
sharpe_equal <-sharpe(stats_eq, mean_eq, sd_eq)
```

```{r}
# Plot
er_sd_view <- cbind(stats_industrials, stats_precious, stats_eq, stats_eff) %>% 
  gather(mean_return, values_er, c(mean_ind, mean_prec, mean_eff, mean_eq)) %>% 
  gather(volatility, values_vola, c(sd_ind, sd_prec, sd_eff, sd_eq)) %>% 
  rownames_to_column("return") %>% 
  slice(1, 6, 11, 16) %>% 
  subset(select = -return) %>% 
  mutate(values_vola = values_vola) %>%
  mutate(values_er = values_er)

ggplot(er_sd_view) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = values_vola, y = values_er, color = mean_return)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0.005, 0.017)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.00015, 0.0003)) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2", name = "Portfolio", labels = c("Efficient", "50/50", "Industrial Metals", "Precious Metals")) + 
  labs(
    title = "E(Return)/Volatility Plot for the Individual portfolios", 
    x = "Volatility",
    y = "Expected Return"
  ) +

```

## Technical Indicator

From https://uc-r.github.io/ts_moving_averages

The concept of simple moving averages can be extended to taking moving averages of moving averages. This technique is often employed with an even number of data points so that the final product is symmetric around each point. 

INSERT PAPERS HERE THAT TALK ABOUT THE APPLICABILITY OF THE TMA 
Naved and Srivastava (2015) showed that in their dataset, moving averages outperformed buy-and-hold strategies.
> An optimization technique is used to find the most profitable trading system among all the moving averages. The results show that trading rules based short term simple moving average generate more profit with less drawdown and outperform buy-and-hold strategy for almost all type of moving averages.
This result, combined with the relative simplicity dan accompanying flexibility of moving averages makes them an attractive tool for analysis and trading.

An even-numbered moving average is unbalanced, and for our purposes, the unbalancing will be in favor of more recent observations. For example, to calculate a 4-MA, the equation is as follows:
$$\hat{y}_{n} = \frac{y_{t-2} + y_{t-1} + y_{t} + y_{t+1} + y_{t+2}}{5}$$
To make the moving average symmetric (and therefore more accurate), we then take a 2-MA of the 4-MA to create a 2 x 4-MA. For the 2-MA step, we average the current and previous moving averages.
$$\hat{y}_{n} = \frac{1}{8}y_{t-2} + \frac{1}{4}y_{t-1} + \frac{1}{4}y_{t} + \frac{1}{4}y_{t+1} + \frac{1}{8}y_{t+2} $$
This general formula can be adapted for the exact period that is desired as the output, using R (below). 

### Finding appropriate Modifiers for the TMA

The main challenge lies in finding the appropriate time periods for the TMA. As it is an average of averages, we have to consider which of these will give us the best return. 
The best TMA will be one that fits the trend well enough, but can still react to changes in the underlying assets quickly enough to be useful.
To compute a basic TMA, we can use the ma() function and take a look at the output, in this case with a 60 day compound.
```{r, fig.width = 10}
# rolling averages. Useful for later calculations
# k = number of days used in average
portfolios_tma <- four_portfolios_consolidated %>% 
  group_by(index) %>% 
  mutate(tma100 = ma(values, order = 100, centre = TRUE))

eq_efficient <- portfolios_tma %>% 
  filter(index %in% c("eq_weight", "efficient"))

# 60 Day TMAs over the daily data for the two composite portfolios
ggplot(eq_efficient) +
  geom_line(aes(x = date, y=values, group = index), 
            alpha = 0.8, fill = "black", size = 0.2) +
  geom_line(aes(x = date, y=tma100, color = index)) + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette="Dark2", name = "Series", labels = c("Efficient Portfolio", "Equal Weights")) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "12 months", date_labels =  "%Y") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=60, hjust=1))
```

In order to see the performance of any portfolio, we have to implement buy and sell signals. In our case, as described earlier, the idea would be to buy when the TMA is passed upwards, and to sell & short when the line crosses below. 
To do this, we can use the code suggested [on the QuantInst Blog](https://blog.quantinsti.com/an-example-of-a-trading-strategy-coded-in-r/)

```{r, include = FALSE}
# just trying something
pf_lag <-  na.omit(lag(pf_subset))

pf_lag_e <- pf_lag %>% 
  filter(index %in% "industrial_metals") %>% 
  mutate(dema = DEMA(values, 20, wilder = TRUE))

pf_lag_e$buy_signal_dema <- ifelse(pf_lag_e$dema < pf_lag_e$values, 1, 0)
pf_lag_e <-  na.omit(lag(pf_lag_e))


# Simple Buy/Sell Signals
pf_lag_e$buy_signal <- ifelse(pf_lag_e$tma60 < pf_lag_e$values, 1, 0)

# https://www.jstor.org/stable/43503762?seq=1 - Paper for Gold

above_ma <-  which(pf_lag_e$buy_signal==1)
trades_time <- split(above_ma, cumsum(c(1, diff(above_ma) >= 4)))
trades_time <- trades_time[sapply(trades_time, length) >= 4]
trades <- lapply(trades_time, function(x){l <- c(x[4],min(x[length(x)]+4, length(pf_lag_e$values)))})
returns <- sapply(trades, function(x){(pf_lag_e$values[x[2]]/pf_lag_e$values[x[1]])-1})
ttl_ret <- sum(returns)


above_ma <-  which(pf_lag_e$buy_signal_dema == 1)
trades_time <- split(above_ma, cumsum(c(1, diff(above_ma) >= 2)))
trades_time <- trades_time[sapply(trades_time, length) >= 2]
trades <- lapply(trades_time, function(x){l <- c(x[2],min(x[length(x)]+2, length(pf_lag_e$values)))})
returns <- sapply(trades, function(x){(pf_lag_e$values[x[2]]/pf_lag_e$values[x[1]])})
ttl_ret <- prod(returns)-1

kelly <- (stats_eff$mean_eff - (risk_free / 365)) / (stats_eff$sd_eff)^2
kelly

```
In order to trade on these signals, we have to know how much money we are willing to invest on a given trade. TO do this, we will apply a simple version of the kelly criterion (Khanna, 2016), and use its static value as the input for how much of our portfolio we are betting on a trade. 
```{r}
# Kelly Criterion
# Trade based on Signals
portfolio_purse <- 100
```

```{r}
# Plot Daily Returns
```


This would give us a return of [TBA]

Using the optimize function we employed to get the portfolio weights earlier, we can attempt to maximise the output of our TMA line on both portfolios. 

## DEMA - Double Exponential Moving Average
The TMA comes with a double edged sword of reacting slowly to price changes, letting one exploit a trend for longer, but also risking greater exopsure to losses. A double exponential moving average does not run this risk, eliminating most of the lag that persists in moving-averages models. 

```{r}
ggplot(pf_subset) +
  geom_line(aes(x = date, y=values, group = index), 
            alpha = 0.8, fill = "black", size = 0.2) +
  geom_line(aes(x = date, y=ma4, color = index)) + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette="Dark2", name = "Series", labels = c("Efficient Portfolio", "Equal Weights")) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "12 months", date_labels =  "%Y") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=60, hjust=1)) + 

DEMA(pf_subset$index, n=10, v=1)
```


DEMA vs TMA Graph on the Portfolios
```{r}
# DEMA vs TMA

```



## Market Choice
```{r, fig.width = 5}
combined_indices %>% 
  subset(select = c(precious_metals, industrial_metals)) %>% 
  ggpairs(combined_indices)
```

As the above correlation graph shows, and intuition would confirm, there is an extreme correlation between the different classes of metals. This is despite the fact that gold, which makes up a large part of the precious metals index, is traded less for its value as a metal from an utilitarian perspective and more because of it's economic value as a crisis/hedging asset.
