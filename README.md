# Trading Strategy
This readme is not so much to explain teh project, the output file does that well enough (I hope, given that the point of the RMD is to be a 'paper').
This is to talk about some of my experiences working with R. This project is the first time I've had to/gotten to actally use a programming language in order to compile a somewhat useful output. 
## Functions in R
I hate them. Why does the Sharpe Function work for the efficient and equal portfolios, but not for the individual ones? What the hell, man.

## Working with LaTeX
I love this kind of stuff, because it always does exactly what you need it to. Once you get the hang of the [endless lists of commands](https://rpruim.github.io/s341/S19/from-class/MathinRmd.html).
